<H2>Facing my fear, Giant swing</H2>

<p> What is the most adventorous thing that you did in your life ? </p>

 Dear TMOD, fellow members and guests, Good eveing to all of you <br />

<p>I am an adventurous person by nature. Since my second year at my college, I have been doing various adventure activities like rock climbing, hiking, rappelling, scuba diving, paragliding. If you want to do something fun activity, I am your man. But there was an adventure activity I thought I could never do, that is bungee jumping. I thought I don't have the courage to the endure the free fall. </p>

<p>After graduation, I joined Samsung and when three of my friends booked tickets for bungee, I was very skeptical.I was so afraid, that I did not book the slot. I thought I will just watch people doing it.So, my friends booked their slots. On the D day,after reaching Rishikesh. We booked a cab and went to a small village, Mohanchatti. My first memory was a small girl jumping with her two hands wide open, with a wide smile on her face, enjoying every moment of the jump.We checked into the cafeteria, where giant screens were screening people performing Bungee. I gathered courage and decided I am not leaving this spot without doing something exciting and memorable for rest of my life.    </p>


<p>So I asked the manager, I want to do the Bunjee. He smiled and said the slots are all filled, but you can do Giant Swing instead. Both are almost same. In Giant swing, you jump from the same bridge, with a rope tied to your waist. Once your jump, you fall freely for 80 m and the rope gets tight and you start oscillating to and fro for 10-15 times across the river. After paying the money, I went to the tall bridge, where all jumping takes place, I was questioning myself why did I agree to do it?It was same nervousness that I generally get before public speaking. 
</p>  

<p> My turn soon came. An Australian lady was preparing me. I asked her jokingly " I am not going to  die right ? " She said "within next 15 min, you won't die, after that, it is not in my hand."She explained to me all the rules, tied the ropes and suggested me, don't look down, look straight and take the jump. <br /> I was never more afraid, but I gathered courage and on their green signal, I took the leap of faith and jumped looking straight. I was terrified beyond imagination, the free fall of 80 meters seemed to me forever although it lasted only 5-6 seconds. Everything was in slow motion. I can't not describe it in words, it was like a high, an adrenaline rush I never experienced before. I felt like a bird far from the confinement and constraint of the world. I was screaming as loud as I could and I felt my soul was out of my body. Once I reached down, the rope tightened as I started screaming "I did it, I did it."<br />

I started swinging, once the rope was tight.  I could see the river down me and the beauty was breathtaking. While swinging I covered the river from the air again and again. I started to come down. As soon as I reached down, I jumped in the small river, washed my face and drank water. I felt like a warrior who just won the entire world by his courage !! </p>



<p>---------------- PART 5 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;</p>
<p>By the time I reached the reception, my video was ready. I was watching it again and again and I still reliving the moment. After that, I went for river rafting in Rishikesh and did cliff jumping where you have to jump from a 20-meter high rock into the water. I was so psyched after giant swing I did the jump 3-4 times. It was the most adventurous day of my life and I will remember it till the end of my life.  </p> <b> 83 </b>

<p> I would like to finish by saying, "If something excites you and scares you the same time, it is worth a try ". Get out of your comfort zone and do something which scares you the most. It is going to be an amazing experiece.  </p>
